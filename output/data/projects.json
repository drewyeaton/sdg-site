The core of Seevolution&rsquo;s offering is an on-site toolbar that provides traffic data on the actual page that generates it. Seevolution called on Sentinel Design to help create a simple way to interact with and visualize the multitude of data points they are collecting for their customers and also to develop a minimal-friction sign-up process.</p><p>Sentinel Design started  by developing a system of displaying multiple chart-filled panels all contained in a toolbar-style interface. Using best practices and 8 years of web development experience, Sentinel Design also created a website to advertise the service and convert visitors into customers. The Seevolution website was also designed with HTML5 and CSS3 features in mind so that developers could easily apply new CSS trickery to create a beautiful, standards-based website.</p><p>Seevolution is <a href='http://www.seevolution.com/' target='blank'>launching soon</a>.</p>"

The core philosophy of SimplyPowered is to take mass-produced, easily attainable clean tech, and package it in a way that accessible to the non-tech-savvy home owner. Sentinel Design&rsquo;s job was to develop a brand that encompass these ideas and create a system that communicates how powerful or efficient SimplyPowered's systems are.</p><p>Our primary deliverable was the SimplyPowered logo. The circle-squigly-arrow symbol is a common fixture in dictionaries to denote a topic or concept that belongs to the area of electricity. Seeing this as an obvious starting point for a enduring logo, Sentinel Design added some design sensibilities with a durable typeface to create a tough and simple identity for the company.</p><p>The SimplyPowered site can be viewed online at <a href='http://simplypowered.net/' target='_blank'>http://simplypowered.net/</a></p>"
